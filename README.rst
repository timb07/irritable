Irritable implements broken iterators called irritables


* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://irritable.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

Iterators are defined in the docs_; the definition includes what
constitutes a broken implementation:

    4.5. Iterator Types

    [...]

    Once an iteratorâ€™s ``__next__()`` method raises StopIteration, it must
    continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not
    obey this property are deemed broken.

*Irritables* are like iterables, but deliberately broken. The following
types of brokenness are supported:

- after ``next()`` first raises ``StopIteration``, subsequent calls will
  raise ``StopIrritation`` instead;

- if the irritator is instantiated with ``resume=True``, calling
  ``next()`` may raise ``StopIteration`` when items still remain in
  the container; subsequent calls to ``next()`` will return the remaining
  items as usual until none remain;

- if the irritator is instantiated with ``repeat=True``, after the
  iterator has been exhausted and raises ``StopIteration``, the iterator
  is reset and can be iterated over again ad infinitum; in this case
  ``next()`` will never raise ``StopIrritation``;

The idea for irritators came during Trey Hunner's talk_ "Loop better:
a deeper look at iteration in Python" at DjangoCon AU 2017.
